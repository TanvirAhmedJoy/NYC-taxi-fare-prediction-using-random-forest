# NYC-taxi-fare-prediction-using-random-forest
NYC Taxi Fare Prediction project comparing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LSTM models using 2023 Yellow Taxi data. Implements comprehensive feature engineering for temporal, spatial, and trip metrics. Random Forest achieved best performance across all fare ranges, followed by an ensemble model combining all approaches.
